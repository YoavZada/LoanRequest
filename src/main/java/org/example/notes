the project does not classify objects the why i want them to.
for example when i input values of a rejected loan it  somehow gets approved.
the machine learning model has an error for 35 instances, yet i do not think this is the issue because there are more than 480 rejeted loans.
i beleive th problem is with the insufficient data that i have , i need more data!.
also i think using a lot of columns/catogories for the model does not enable it to make the decisions i want it to make for example in case of low income and a high loan amount request.
